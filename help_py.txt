You are a python and graph theory expert. You will be helping me to 
write python code implementing algorithms on graphs.
Please do not guess answers. Write algorithms that work. 
Explain each step along the way.
Let 
nds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
edgs = [(0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (10, 1), (10, 4), (11, 2), (11, 5), (12, 3), (12, 6), (1, 13), (1, 14), (13, 2), (13, 7), (14, 3), (14, 8), (2, 15), (15, 3), (15, 9), (4, 16), (4, 17), (16, 5), (16, 7), (17, 6), (17, 8), (5, 18), (18, 6), (18, 9), (7, 19), (19, 8), (19, 9)]
D is graphs with D.nodes = nds and D.edges=edgs.

Each node has a string label. Node labels are stored in the dictionary
node_labels = {0: '{1, 2}',
 1: '{1, 3}',
 2: '{1, 4}',
 3: '{1, 5}',
 4: '{2, 3}',
 5: '{2, 4}',
 6: '{2, 5}',
 7: '{3, 4}',
 8: '{3, 5}',
 9: '{4, 5}',
 10: '{1, 2, 3}',
 11: '{1, 2, 4}',
 12: '{1, 2, 5}',
 13: '{1, 3, 4}',
 14: '{1, 3, 5}',
 15: '{1, 4, 5}',
 16: '{2, 3, 4}',
 17: '{2, 3, 5}',
 18: '{2, 4, 5}',
 19: '{3, 4, 5}'}

Write python codes that finds all Hamiltonian paths in D.
Write your answer and explations in markup format.


Here is an example of a Hamiltonian path that you will compute.
P = [0, 10, 1, 13, 2, 11, 5, 18, 6, 12, 3, 14, 8, 17, 4, 16, 7, 19, 9, 15]
Write python code that plots the following graph.
On the left hand side  plot circles for nodes from 0 to 9 with corresponding labels.
    Show node number labels in each circle.
    
On the right hand side  plot circles for nodes from 10 to 19 with corresponding labels.
     Show node number labels in each circle.
Then connect circles according to the Hamiltonian path P.
